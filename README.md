Hi, I’m a Software Engineer focused on Full Stack Development. I’m currently learning and exploring DevOps, Web3, and App Development using React Native.

I’ve been working part-time at BrandRoot Isoft, where I also started with internships. From day one, I’ve been involved in real-world work — contributing to over 50 projects and continuing to take on new challenges.

I began as a Frontend Intern, moved into WordPress Development, and later started contributing part-time as a Frontend Developer, WordPress Developer, and UI/UX Designer. I’m now working as a Full Stack Developer, still actively involved in both development and design.
